I am a rising senior studying Economics and Mathematics (Joint Major) at NYU. My current academic interests include Urban Economics, Development Economics, and Policy Analysis. At the same time, I am also pursuing a Master's Degree in Economics at NYU as part of the joint Bachelor-Master's [Program](https://cas.nyu.edu/bachmast/gsas.html) with NYU [GSAS](https://gsas.nyu.edu). I also run a Chinese cultural [club](https://www.instagram.com/nyucms/) on campus.

In my free time I play guitar and transcribe music (more info on transcriptions page). I also like cycling and solo travelling to cool places.
