I am a Master's student on the [Joint B.A./M.A.](https://cas.nyu.edu/bachmast/gsas.html) track in Economics at NYU CAS/[GSAS](https://gsas.nyu.edu). I have a rigorous background in econometrics (both applied and theoretical), and I have professional experience in applied statistics and statistical consulting. I'm interested in the application of econometric and causal inference methods to analyze policy questions, particularly those involving health, cities, and human development. I also (used to) run a Chinese cultural [club](https://www.instagram.com/nyucms/) on campus.

In my free time I play guitar and transcribe music (more info on [transcriptions](/transcriptions/) page). I also like cycling and solo travelling to cool places (when money permits).
